[![Agent Plugins](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent%20Plugins-v1.0.0-teal?style=flat-square)](https://agent-plugins.org)

> A curated, install-ready directory for the [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) ecosystem — the self-improving AI agent from [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com). Covers the **82 built-in skills** and **117-skill optional catalog** that ship with Hermes v0.20.6, plus **169 community skills, plugins, agent profiles, memory providers, surfaces, and tools** vetted for quality.

Hermes is the only agent with a real learning loop. It writes its own skills from your workflows, searches its own past conversations, and runs anywhere — a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, serverless, or your laptop. But the agent is only as powerful as the skills you give it. **This list is the shortcut.** Pick three, install in a minute, and your agent is twice as useful by tonight.

## ⭐ Featured Skill

> **youtube-full** : Get YouTube transcripts, search videos, browse channels, and extract playlists from any AI agent.
>
> ```bash
> hermes skills install skills-sh/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-skills/skills/youtube-full
> ```
>
> The fastest way to feel what Hermes can do. Install it, then ask: *"Summarize the last 5 videos from Lex Fridman."* Your agent fetches the transcripts, summarizes them, and remembers what you watched, all in one prompt. No Google API key, and nothing to install or maintain. Powered by [TranscriptAPI](https://transcriptapi.com). Works in Hermes, Claude, OpenClaw and other agent runtimes.

## 🚀 Where Do I Start?

New to Hermes? Don't try to install everything at once. Here's the three-step path from zero to "wait, my agent can do that?":

1. **Get Hermes running** — Follow the [official quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/). 10 minutes from clone to first conversation. Hermes ships with [82 built-in skills](#-built-in-skills-ships-with-hermes) — plus a [117-skill optional catalog](#-optional-skills-bundled-with-hermes) — the day you install it, so even before you add anything from this list, you can already do a lot.

2. **Install your first skill — `youtube-full`**
   ```bash
   hermes skills install skills-sh/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-skills/skills/youtube-full
   ```
   Then ask: *"Get the transcript for this video and summarize it: [paste any YouTube URL]"*. The "I get it" moment lands in 30 seconds. From there try: *"Find the top 5 videos about quantum computing and tell me what they agree on."*

3. **Pick a workflow upgrade** — Add [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) for a full GUI, or [SkillClaw](https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SkillClaw) so your skill library auto-evolves while you work.

Browse the categories below. Every entry is tagged so you know what you're getting:

| Tag | What it means |
|-----|---------------|
| **built-in** | Ships with Hermes — already installed when you run `hermes` |
| **production** | Stable, documented, actively maintained — safe to build on |
| **beta** | Works but still evolving — expect rough edges |
| **experimental** | Proof of concept — fun to try, don't depend on it |

## ⭐ Editor's Picks

A short hand-picked list to get you started. If you install nothing else from this page, install these.

*Selection is editorial; the order is not. Picks are listed **most-starred first**, so the ranking is something you can check rather than something you have to trust. Counts re-pulled from the GitHub API 2026-08-24 09:23 UTC; on a list this size they drift within hours, so treat the figure as of that timestamp and the ordering as the durable claim.*

### 🛠️ mattpocock/skills — Skills For Real Engineers
**production** · [Matt Pocock](https://github.com/mattpocock) · [Repo](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) · 242.3k★

```bash
npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills
```

Twenty-three battle-tested skills from the Total TypeScript creator. The `grill-me` and `grill-with-docs` skills force the agent to interview you before writing code — the single best fix for "the agent didn't do what I wanted." `tdd` enforces red-green-refactor. `improve-codebase-architecture` rescues codebases that have become balls of mud. `wayfinder` maps work too big for one session onto decision tickets. Built for real engineering work, not vibe coding. Pick the ones you want with the installer's interactive picker.

### 🖥️ hermes-workspace
**production** · [outsourc-e](https://github.com/outsourc-e) · [Repo](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) · 6.5k★

Web-based workspace with chat, terminal, memory browser, skills manager, and inspector. The most complete GUI for Hermes. Built during Nous Hackathon 2026. Pairs well with everything else on this list.

### 🔬 SkillClaw
**production** · [AMAP-ML](https://github.com/AMAP-ML) · [Repo](https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SkillClaw) · 2.5k★

Open-source companion that auto-evolves, deduplicates, and improves your skill library from real session data. Sits on top of Hermes's built-in skill creation and adds a post-task evolution loop. Native Hermes integration via `~/.hermes/skills`, with safety flows (`skillclaw doctor hermes` / `skillclaw restore hermes`).

### 🎬 youtube-full
**production** · [@therohitdas](https://github.com/therohitdas) · [Repo](https://github.com/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-skills) · 586★

```bash
hermes skills install skills-sh/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-skills/skills/youtube-full
```

If your agent can't read YouTube, half the internet is invisible to it. This skill gives Hermes transcript extraction, channel browsing, search, and playlist parsing — no Google API key, and nothing to install or maintain. Powered by [TranscriptAPI](https://transcriptapi.com). Works in Hermes, Claude, OpenClaw and other agent runtimes.

### 🛡️ resemble-ai/detect-skill
**beta** · [Resemble AI](https://github.com/resemble-ai) · [Repo](https://github.com/resemble-ai/detect-skill) · 71★

Deepfake detection for agents that ingest user-submitted media. Detects AI-generated audio, image, video, and text. Traces audio source (ElevenLabs, Resemble, etc.), applies invisible watermarks for provenance, and verifies speaker identity. The first thing to install if your agent reads the public internet.

## 🔄 Skills → Plugins

> The **[Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org)** standard (spec v1.0.0, published 2026-08-06 by Amazon, Anysphere/Cursor, GitHub, Microsoft, OpenAI and Vercel, with Google as a core maintainer) bundles Agent Skills *and* MCP servers into one portable folder. If you already ship a `SKILL.md`, you are most of the way there.

A plugin is a directory:

```
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json          # $schema + name required; version, description, license, author, repository
├── skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
├── mcp.json             # mcpServers: stdio | streamable-http | sse
└── com.vendor.client/   # namespaced client extensions
```

Runtime variables `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` resolve at load time. Path containment is enforced, `command` does no shell interpolation, and credentials must not be embedded — read the spec before you publish.

**Why it matters for this list:** the artifact churns, the ecosystem doesn't. A skill you wrote for Hermes runs unchanged inside a plugin, and that plugin also loads in ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro and VS Code. Several entries here already ship both shapes — look for a `.claude-plugin/` directory or a `plugin.json` next to the `skills/` folder.

**Converting an existing skill:**

- [Agent Plugins spec](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec) — the normative source. Schemas at [agent-plugins.org/schemas](https://agent-plugins.org/schemas).
- [awesome-agent-plugins](https://github.com/ZeroPointRepo/awesome-agent-plugins): our sister list of plugins that already ship a real 1.0.0 `plugin.json`. Useful as worked examples before you write your own, and it tracks which clients actually load them.
- [claude-plugin-converter](https://github.com/moonlight-lupin/agent-skills/tree/main/agent-ops/claude-plugin-converter) by [moonlight-lupin](https://github.com/moonlight-lupin) — analyses a Claude Code plugin and emits an installable Hermes plugin. The closest thing to a one-command migration today. **[beta]**
